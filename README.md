==================

Work-in-progress dashboard for viewing Sunlight Foundation data with Ember.
But its going to be awesome.

#For the Front End
Install Ember-CLI to get started and follow [their documentation](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/) to start it up.  This is used for the frontend.

#For the API
In a seperate tab, move into api folder.
`cd api`

Install node and npm (if you haven't already).  Then install dependencies and run it!
`npm install`
`node server`

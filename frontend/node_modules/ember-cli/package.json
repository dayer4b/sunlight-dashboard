  "readme": "\n## ember-cli [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-cli.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-cli) [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/stefanpenner/ember-cli.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/stefanpenner/ember-cli)\n\nAn ember command line utility.\n\nSupports node 0.10.5 and npm 1.4.6.\n\n## Community\n* irc: #ember-cli on freenode\n* issues: [ember-cli/issues](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/issues)\n* website: [iamstef.net/ember-cli](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli)\n\n\n[![ScreenShot](http://static.iamstef.net/ember-conf-2014-video.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4D8z3972h64)\n\n\n## Warning\n\nAlthough potentially exciting, this is still really a WIP, use at your own risk.\n\n## Project Elements\nAdditional components of this project which are used runtime in your application:\n* [ember-jj-abrams-resolver](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-jj-abrams-resolver)\n* [loader](https://github.com/stefanpenner/loader.js)\n* [ember-cli-shims](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli-shims)\n* [ember-load-initializers](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-load-initializers)\n\n## Development Hints\n### Working with master\n\n``` sh\ngit clone https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli.git\ncd ember-cli\nnpm link\n```\n\n`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package from the repo the just cloned `ember-cli/` folder becomes the global package. Any changes to the files in the `ember-cli/` folder will immediatly affect the global ember-cli package.\n\nNow you can use `ember-cli` via the command line:\n\n``` sh\nember new foo\ncd foo\nnpm link ember-cli\nember server\n```\n\n`npm link ember-cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `ember-cli` just loads the local `ember-cli` from the project. `npm link ember-cli` symlinks the global `ember-cli` package to the local `ember-cli` package. Now the `ember-cli` you cloned before is in three places: The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the `ember-cli` project you just created.\n\nIf you upgrade an app running against Ember CLI master you will need to re-link to your checkout of Ember CLI by running `npm link ember-cli` in your project again.\n\nPlease read the official [npm-link documentation](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html) and the [npm-link cheatsheet](https://blog.nodejitsu.com/npm-cheatsheet/#Linking_any_npm_package_locally) for more information.\n\n### Working with the tests\n\nUse `npm run-script autotest` to run the tests after every file change (Runs only fast tests). Use `npm test` to run them once.\n\nTo exclude a test or test suite append a `.skip` to `it()` or `describe()` respectively (e.g. `it.skip(...)`). To focus on a certain test or test suite append `.only`.\n\nPlease read the official [mocha documentation](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha) for more information.\n\n## License\n\nember-cli is [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-cli/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n",
